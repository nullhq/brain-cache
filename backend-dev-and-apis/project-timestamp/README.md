# Timestamp Microservice

To accomplish this cool project similar to this: https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks, 
- i've deeply understand the `Date` object in JS
    - valueOf, Date.parse(), 
- i've also learn tath it's possible to add a optional parameter with express by doing somthing like `/api/:param?`
    - only `?` change everything !
